# Welcome to [**`pyppbox`**](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox) !

## 🐍📦 [**`pyppbox`**](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox) = Python + People + Toolbox 

* Yes, **`pyppbox`** is an open-source Python toolbox which was originally made for the PoseTReID framework. 
* This toolbox features 3 main modules: People Detection module, People Tracking module, and People Re-identifying module. These modules support a bunch of well-known people detectors, trackers, and re-identificators which can be used separately or put together with only a few lines of code. 
* **`pyppbox`** also supports real-time online and offline evaluation on [PoseTReID datasets](https://github.com/rathaumons/PoseTReID_DATASET).
* The initial version of **`pyppbox`** is also intergrated with GUI for easy demo and config.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICES (May 9, 2023)
* 🆕 **The [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/rathaumons/ultralytics-for-pyppbox) is soon available for `pyppbox`!** 🆕
* [`OpenPose`](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) submodule was removed due to [its complicated license](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/LICENSE) -> Check this repo [`pyppbox-paper`](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox-paper) if you need `OpenPose` or need to reproduce the results in the paper.
* **Check more important releases/commits here [OLDRELEASENOTES.md](OLDRELEASENOTES.md).**

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Please check the [README.md](requirements/README.md) in [requirements](requirements) (Can be installed later).

## 🚀 Setup `pyppbox`

### Option 1: Use the [prebuilt WHL file here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LY5WNsSoEMwxYjET26yry4AQMHiPDaM0) 
* `pip install pyppbox-xxx.whl`

### Option 2: Build your own `pyppbox`
* Download [the extra models & weights](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EQzkwZ8aCpZqGrgxEo6PD_8hPhHlcaqz) and extract to the root [`pyppbox`](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox/)
* Create WHL by running `creat_whl.cmd`
* Install newly created WHL `pip install pyppbox-xxx.whl`

### Quick Test
* On your terminal or CMD:
```
python
import pyppbox
pyppbox.launchGUI()
```
* Now you should see [the GUI of pyppbox for easy demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rathaROG/screenshot/master/pyppbox/pyppbox_launchGUI_main.png). Just hit the "LAUNCH" button!
