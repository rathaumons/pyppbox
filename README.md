# Welcome to pyppbox !

## 🐍📦 pyppbox = Python  + People + Toolbox 

* Yes, pyppbox is an open-source Python toolbox which was originally made for the PoseTReID framework. 
* This toolbox features 3 main modules: People Detection module, People Tracking module, and People Re-identifying module. These modules support a bunch of well-known people detectors, trackers, and re-identificators which can be used separately or put together with only a few lines of code. 
* **pyppbox** also supports real-time online and offline evaluation on [PoseTReID datasets](https://github.com/rathaumons/PoseTReID_DATASET).
* The initial version of pyppbox is also intergrated with GUI for easy demo and config.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICES (July 27, 2022)

* Add GPLv3+ license
* OpenPose is completely removed due to [the complicated license of OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/LICENSE) and it will be replaced by [MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose) in the future versions. Stay tune for this amazing update!
* Please refer to [this repo pyppbox-paper](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox-paper) for those who want OpenPose or want to reproduce the results in the paper.

## ⚙️ Requirements

* This is the very first version of pyppbox, and we currently support only **Windows** due to the incompatibility of some modules on other platforms with the latest hardware.

* This current version supports only **Python 3.9.x** and **CUDA 11.3.x** & **CUDNN 8.3.x**. If you wish to build pyppbox on different version of Python and CUDA & CUDNN, etc., you must build the corresponding required packages such as [opencv-contrib-python (With CVDNN)](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox/blob/main/requirements/cust/opencv_contrib_python-4.5.5-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl) and the [customized torchreid](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox/blob/main/requirements/cust/torchreid-1.4.0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl) (Check out the [customized torchreid repo here](https://github.com/rathaumons/torchreid-for-pyppbox)).

### Install requirements
* Optional: If you prefer conda, you can create a virtual conda **Python 3.9** enviroment of your choice.
```
conda create --name pyppbox_env python=3.9
conda activate pyppbox_env
```
* Simply run the install_pippackages.cmd
```
cd requirements
install_pippackages.cmd
```

### Verify the requirements
* Simply run the testme.cmd
```
testme.cmd
```
* If there is no error, then you're all good and ready to go.

## 🚀 Setup pyppbox

### Option 1: Use the prebuilt WHL file
* Download [WHL here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LY5WNsSoEMwxYjET26yry4AQMHiPDaM0) and install `pip install pyppbox-1.0b7-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl`

### Option 2: Build your own pyppbox
* Download [the extra models & weights](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EQzkwZ8aCpZqGrgxEo6PD_8hPhHlcaqz) and extract to the root `pyppbox`
* Create WHL by running `creat_whl.cmd`
* Install WHL `pip install pyppbox-1.0b7-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl`

### Quick Test
* On your terminal or CMD:
```
python
import pyppbox
pyppbox.launchGUI()
```
* Now you should see [the GUI of pyppbox for easy demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rathaROG/screenshot/master/pyppbox/pyppbox_launchGUI.png). Just hit the "LAUNCH" button!
