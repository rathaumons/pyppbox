## üêçüì¶ pyppbox = Python  + People + Toolbox 

* Yes, pyppbox is an open-source Python toolbox which is originally made for PoseTReID framework. 
* This toolbox features 3 main moduels: People Detection module, People Tracking module, and People Re-identifying module. These modules support a bunch of well-known people detectors, trackers, and re-identificators which can be used separately or put together with only a few line of codes. 
* **pyppbox** also supports real-time online and offline evaluation on [PoseTReID datasets](https://github.com/rathaumons/PoseTReID_DATASET).
* The initial version of pyppbox is also intergrated with GUI for easy demo and config.
