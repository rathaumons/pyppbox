# Welcome to [**`pyppbox`**](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox) !

This repo was reinitiated from version 1.0b9. The complete history is available here [33da563](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox/tree/33da56302d27204931337b44d9a6a5adc1eb5257).

## üêçüì¶ [**`pyppbox`**](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox) = Python + People + Toolbox 

* Yes, **`pyppbox`** is an open-source Python toolbox which was originally made for the PoseTReID framework. 
* This toolbox features 3 main modules: People Detection module, People Tracking module, and People Re-identifying module. These modules support a bunch of well-known people detectors, trackers, and re-identificators which can be used separately or put together with only a few lines of code. 
* **`pyppbox`** also supports real-time online and offline evaluation on [PoseTReID datasets](https://github.com/rathaumons/PoseTReID_DATASET).
* The initial version of **`pyppbox`** is also intergrated with GUI for easy demo and config.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTICES (Febuary 10, 2023)

* üÜï Introduce **GLOBAL** & **LOCAL** `cfg` for multi-threading application -> Check [`examples`](examples) page for more details.
* Add GPLv3+ license
* [`OpenPose`](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) submodule is completely removed due to [the complicated license of OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/LICENSE) ~~and it will be replaced by [MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose) in the future versions. Stay tune for this amazing update!~~ üÜï **Maybe the [official YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) instead!** üÜï
* Please refer to [this repo `pyppbox-paper`](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox-paper) for those who need `OpenPose` or need to reproduce the results in the paper.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* Please check the [README.md](requirements/README.md) in [requirements](requirements) (Can be installed later).

## üöÄ Setup `pyppbox`

### Option 1: Use the [prebuilt WHL file here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LY5WNsSoEMwxYjET26yry4AQMHiPDaM0) 
* `pip install pyppbox-xxx.whl`

### Option 2: Build your own `pyppbox`
* Download [the extra models & weights](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EQzkwZ8aCpZqGrgxEo6PD_8hPhHlcaqz) and extract to the root [`pyppbox`](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox/)
* Create WHL by running `creat_whl.cmd`
* Install newly created WHL `pip install pyppbox-xxx.whl`

### Quick Test
* On your terminal or CMD:
```
python
import pyppbox
pyppbox.launchGUI()
```
* Now you should see [the GUI of pyppbox for easy demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rathaROG/screenshot/master/pyppbox/pyppbox_launchGUI_main.png). Just hit the "LAUNCH" button!
